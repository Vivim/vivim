          p In fact, an analysis of the four most popular smartphone brands indicates that the average user has at least 65 apps, and only 23 percent of them are games. This provides business owners with the opportunity to get their brand in front of smartphone owners worldwide, and it also makes it much easier to connect with your existing customers.

          h3 How is a Mobile App Different from My Website?

          p Some companies erroneously believe that having a website makes it unnecessary for them to also have a mobile app. Unfortunately, business owners that rely on this misconception are voluntarily diminishing the impact that they could have on current and potential customers. This is due to the fact that an application is downloaded and installed directly into the user's smartphone or tablet, and it can be run without the usage of the Internet. This provides users with a more immediate experience, and it also keeps your company's name in front of them on a regular basis. For example, most people who have a tablet or smartphone will spend time scrolling through their apps throughout the day, but they are not likely to spend time mindlessly browsing through their website bookmarks. This one aspect alone helps set mobile apps apart, and it makes the price of development more than worthwhile.

          p A well-designed website can definitely capture attention and help consumers find exactly what they are looking for. However, it is typically not feasible to provide your customers with a lot of customizable options, especially if you are working with a tight budget. Fortunately, mobile apps have a lot more flexibility, it is also generally going to be more beneficial for someone to be able to save customized information into an app on their phone because they will be able to access it from anywhere. Keep in mind that the average person checks their smartphone 150 times a day, so this means that you have 150 daily opportunities to capture the attention of each individual consumer.
