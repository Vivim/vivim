          p Given the plethora of programming languages currently available for the creation of Web applications, why would modern developers choose to use Ruby on Rails? The answer is simple. This terse and elegant language not only provides an efficient framework for their code but also speeds development by abstracting and streamlining every day, oft-repeated tasks. 

          p The numerous conventions provided by Ruby on Rails free the programmer from the need to perform time-consuming file configurations during setup. This provision is just one of the ways in which Rails enables programmers to develop an application in a matter of minutes. The language’s flexible nature and particular talent for reducing time-to-market are already serving the needs of such major websites as Twitter, Groupon and yellowpages.com, and its many benefits have recently encouraged such major players as simonandschuster.com to ship their legacy Java and PHP applications over to Rails.

          h3 Smaller Projects Never a Problem

          p As anyone who has dealt with them already knows, oversized and cumbersome applications have a disconcerting habit of failing, and when they do, the fix can consume an exorbitant amount of time. Most IT specialists will agree that the smaller the project, the easier it is to support. Ruby on Rails provides developers with the necessary tools to upgrade any behemoth into a collection of smaller projects that are simpler to run, easier to support and far less likely to crash.

          h3 Rails and RESTful Design

          p Centered on the client-server relationship, the representational state transfer architectural style of Ruby on Rails allows for a logical structure that permits easy opening as an application programming interface. Moreover, its iterative method of development inspires flexibility and fosters collaboration. 

          h3 Why Our Developers Prefer Ruby on Rails

          p Rails has gained a large following in recent years, and the reasons for this are impressive. In addition to being open-source, Ruby on Rails: 

          ul
            li Provides an object-oriented architecture.
            li Gives developers freedom to move efficiently between projects. 
            li Offers an accommodating framework.
            li Is self-documenting.
            li Focuses on testing.
            li Supports hosting on a virtual private server.
            li Offers an extensive library containing nearly 64,000 gems of application-enhancing open-source code.

          h3 Speed and Scalability

          p Although its reliance on runtime compilation can cause applications to run somewhat more slowly than those written in Java or C, the speed of Ruby on Rails is more than sufficient to meet the needs of the vast majority of websites. If a quicker tempo should become necessary, there is always the option of running under JRuby, a platform that permits it to perform in a more Java-like manner.

          h3 A Dynamic and Popular Programming Language

          p As additional developers come to appreciate the flexibility of Ruby on Rails, the popularity of this dynamic language continues to move ahead in ever-more-giant strides. Today, it stands as the fourth most-requested language for developing Web applications, and as its community continues to expand, so, too, does the number of pre-coded gems that help to speed Web development. We appreciate Ruby on Rails for allowing us to provide our clients with the unique, stable and easily maintained websites they deserve in the speediest, most efficient way possible.
